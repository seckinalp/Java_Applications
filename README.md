# Java_Applications
My solutions for some Java problems from Bilkent University CS101/102 courses.
##Topics
'CS101': We're jumping straight into Java, building from the ground up. It's all about mastering the basics: loops, arrays, and object-oriented programming.

'CS102': In CS 102 Algorithms and Programming II, we dive deeper into Java, mastering advanced techniques like inheritance, polymorphism, and recursion. It's not just about lectures; we get to apply what we learn through programming assignments, preparing us for a major team project. This project challenges us to create a professional-quality Java app, pushing our coding skills, teamwork, and creativity to new levels. Plus, we get to practice presenting our work, which helps in understanding the importance of clear communication in tech.
